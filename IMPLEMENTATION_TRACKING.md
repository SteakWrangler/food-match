# Implementation Tracking: Favorites and Room History

## Original User Request
> "I would like to add some more Supabase stuff into the code for data we're saving, and also write the code to have the UI functionality to actually do that. What I'd like is for Supabase to save data on users' favorite restaurants and to save past rooms that users created and the data inside of them so they can be recreated without making an API call. As far as the favorites goes, we would just have a favorite icon over a restaurant card in the UI that they could click or unclick to just add things to their favorites, and then that specific card would just be added to their list of favorites in Supabase if they're a user. If they're not a user or they're not signed in, they don't get a favorites button, so the favorites button should only display for signed-in users. For the previous room creations, I want it to be able to recreate the restaurants that were in that room at the time, so essentially they're re-entering the room but with reset stats. It would reset the users currently in the room to be whoever's in that room, and then it would create the room again with the same restaurants. We would save the restaurants that were loaded in last time and load them in again. Another thing to think about though is that if we create the room with the same restaurants as last time but this time for eg. they scroll through them without finding what they want, we would then need to call more restaurants from the API to add like we would for a normal room. Can you talk to me about this stuff? There would also need to be an interface for the user, maybe in their settings, where they can view previous rooms and view their favorites."

- Create user settings modal for managing favorites and room history
- Add room recreation functionality

### Phase 4: Integration
- Integrate favorites functionality with existing restaurant cards
- Integrate room history with existing room management
- Add room recreation with API fallback logic

- Room recreation includes API fallback for additional restaurants

### Security Considerations
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Favorites and room history tied to authenticated user ID
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes on user_id for fast queries
