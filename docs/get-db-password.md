# Getting Your Supabase Database Password

## Step 1: Get Your Database Password

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ahfytcfndbnwrabryjnz/settings/database
2. Scroll down to the "Database Password" section
3. Click "Show" to reveal the password
4. Copy the password (it's a long string)

## Step 2: Test the Connection

Once you have the password, run:

```bash
# Test the connection
supabase db pull -p "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE"

# If that works, you can run migrations
supabase migration new your_migration_name
supabase db push -p "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE"
```

## Step 3: Set as Environment Variable (Optional)

To avoid typing the password each time:

```bash
export SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD="your_password_here"
```

Then you can run commands without the `-p` flag.

## Step 4: Common Migration Commands

```bash
# Create a new migration
supabase migration new add_new_table

# Push migrations to remote
supabase db push -p "YOUR_PASSWORD"

# Pull latest schema from remote
supabase db pull -p "YOUR_PASSWORD"

# List all migrations
supabase migration list -p "YOUR_PASSWORD"
```
